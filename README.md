- I see the Currency Selector, good.
- BUG: The prices are not updated when I click on the button. So please fix the prices update.
- When you choose curreny on the currency selector, the price should change to the current price and the Header (Bitcoin Price should change if it's bitcoin or Ethereum).
- Now, When you work on it. You should branch out from develop branch and create a pull request to develop branch when you are done.
